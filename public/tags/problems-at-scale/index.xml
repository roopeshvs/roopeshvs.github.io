      <description>If you are using AWS Lambda to serve real-time traffic and your Lambda initialization times are high, minimizing response time becomes crucial. One option to achieve this is by utilizing provisioned concurrency. Provisioned Concurrency refers to the number of pre-initialized execution environments allocated to your Lambda function.&#xA;Maintaining a constant provisioned concurrency capacity of 200 for a 512 MB Lambda for a month can cost approximately $1,116 USD! This cost is in addition to the pricing for requests and duration.</description>
