## Canary

[Canary Deployments/Testing](https://cloud.google.com/deploy/docs/deployment-strategies/canary) come from an old British Coal Mining technique involved with exploring mines which often contained poisonous gases like Carbon Monoxide that could kill the miners. The [Canary birds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestic_canary) are good detectors of poisonous gases like Carbon Monoxide, which is also colorless, and odorless; as their respiratory system requires a very high amount of Oxygen. If the canary gets ill or dies ðŸ’€, the miners get an early warning to evacuate.

This testing before going further into the deadly mines is carried over to canary deployment where major problems that could arise because of a new feature can be identified by testing with a limited userbase avoiding production disasters.
