I am a software engineer, currently working at [GGWP](https://www.ggwp.com/), involved with handling infrastructure for products that see over a million requests in a day. Before joining GGWP, I spent 2 years at Presidio, where I closely worked with multiple organisations to help them make their applications and operations move to cloud platforms.

Occasionally, I try to capture interesting bits and pieces from my day-to-day in my [blog here](https://pesh.dev/).
