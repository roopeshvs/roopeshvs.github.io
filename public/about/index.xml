      <description>I am a software engineer, currently working at GGWP, involved with handling infrastructure for products that see over a million requests in a day. Before joining GGWP, I spent 2 years at Presidio, where I closely worked with several organisations to help them make their applications and operations move to cloud platforms.&#xA;Occasionally, I try to capture interesting bits and pieces from my day-to-day in my blog here.</description>
